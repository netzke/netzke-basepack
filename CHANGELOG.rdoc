  * Using date column caused FormPanel to crash
  * Virtual columns are no longer editable by default

* improvements
  * New DSL method (model) for declaring a model for grids
  * New DSL method (column) for declaring columns for grids

  * New :read_only option for FormPanel - makes all fields read-only and removes the "Apply" button.
  * FormPanel implements DSL shortcuts for the following options in default config: :model, :items, :record_id.
  * GridPanel implements DSL shortcuts for the following options in default config: :model, :add_form_config, :edit_form_config, :multi_edit_form_config.
  * New FormPanel option :multi_edit - set when the form is used for editing multiple records at a time
  * Introduce action columns (see BookGridWithColumnActions)

* API changes
  * Skip supporting ModelExtensions. The preferred way is using setters and getters on columns/fields.

= 0.7.1 - 2011-09-04
* bug fix
  * FormPanel: fix the netzke_load endpoint when association fields are present
  * dates were not displayed in date fields, and submitting a form with date fields might result in erasing those fields

  * no meta_where dependencies (searching and filtering done with Arel)

= 0.7.0 - 2011-08-09
* Core 0.7.0 and Ext 4 compatibility
* API changes
  * [JS] Removed the helper BorderLayoutPanel#get<Region>Component method altogether. Use Ext 4 Container#child instead

= v0.6.5 - to be released
* enhancements

  * Moved features and specs to test/basepack_test_app
* bug fix
  * FormPanel with multiple association fields wouldn't submit data correctly
  * GridPanel's forms take over the +text+ configuration option for columns as +fieldLabel+ for default fields

= v0.6.4 - 2011-02-26
* API changes
  * The combo field able to talk to the server has changed its xtype from combobox to netzkeremotecombo. When getting values from the server via AJAX, it expects a 2-dimensional array now, where the first value is the real value (which gets submitted), and the second value is the display value.
  * xdatetime is no more. datetimefield is used instead.

* enhancements
  * Components updated to use Ext.Direct (by @pschyska)
  * New, improved advanced search for GridPanel and PagingFormPanel.
  * One-to-many association support in Form/GridPanel reworked to use the foreign id instead of a string. This gives us more flexibility about what to display in the association column/field, and also provides for performance improvements (no more need to search for the associated record based on the value provided from the column/field).
  * GridPanel now memorizes its columns visibility, position and size (when :persistence is set to true)
  * I18n for GridPanel
  * A default value can now also be assigned to association column/field (the value must be the associated record's ID)
  * Slightly optimized selenium tests (no artificial sleeping whenever possible)

* bug fix
  * Long-standing visual issues with datetime columns in grid panel are solved.

* enhancements
  * I18n for Grid/FormPanel

  * GridPanel passes columns' default values to the "Add in form" form
  * FormPanel can now be used without specifying a model
  * New +commalistcbg+ form field for checkboxes, where boxLabels of selected checkboxes are serialized into comma-separated string (the separator is configurable)
  * New +nradiogroup+ form field for radio buttons, where the value is defined by the boxLabel of the selected radio button
  * New +no_binding+ option for configuring a form field. Set it to "true" when you don't want Netzke to expand the field configuration based on the +name+ property. May be needed in some cases, e.g. when using checkboxes/radio buttons in the form.
  * New +nested_attribute+ option for configuring data attributes (thus applicable for a column, a field, or a +netzke_attribute+ in the model). When set to true for an association attribute (e.g. author__name), assigning a value to it will change the association's attribute, *not* trying to find an association by name and reassign it if found (default behavior).
  * FormPanel shows the "Updating..." mask while sending values to the server (configurable with updateMask option/property)
  * FormPanel now can be used in the "lockable" mode (:config => :lockable), which makes it load initially in "display mode", then "unlock" it, change the values, and "lock" it again (updating the values on the server)

  * GridPanel: you can now configure add/edit/multi_edit/search panels (e.g. to override the fields) and corresponding windows (e.g. to override the title)
