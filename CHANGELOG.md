  * Window now also stores its 'maximized' state

* changes
  * BorderLayoutPanel is removed. Any component can now enable its items persistence by including `Netzke::Basepack::ItemPersistence` module
  * Methods like `netzke_attribute`, `netzke_expose_attributes` etc are gone. Define your columns/fields directly in your grids/forms.
  * Accordion and TabPanel now lazily load the Netzke components by default; set `eager_loading` to true for the components that should be loaded eagerly.

## Grid

### Customizing grid's forms

The windows with a form inside, which is used for adding/(multi-)editing of records, are now referred as: `add_window`, `edit_window` (instead of `add_form` and `edit_form`). Both accept a config param `form_config`, which can be used to configure the contained Form - e.g., to change its layout or even class. For example, to change the layout of a form that is found in the edit window, do the following in your grid class:

    component :edit_window do |c|
      super(c)
      c.form_config.items = [:name, :author__name]
    end

DSL methods `add_form_config`, `edit_form_config`, `multi_edit_form_config`, `add_form_window_config`, `edit_form_window_config`, `multi_edit_form_window_config` are gone.

### Customizing columns

Use the new `column` DSL method that accepts a block:

    column :extra_column do |c|
      c.text = "Extra"
    end

If needed, this can be overridden in the subclass the same way as components and actions can be.

DSL method `override_column` is gone.

### Misc

`Grid.extended_search_available` -> `Grid.advanced_search_available`

# 0.7.2 - 2011-10-20
* bug fix
  * Filter on a date column
  * Using date column caused Form to crash
  * Virtual columns are no longer editable by default

* improvements
  * New DSL method (model) for declaring a model for grids
  * New DSL method (column) for declaring columns for grids
  * New :override_columns config option for grid allows overriding specified column config without influencing other columns' order/presence
  * New DSL method (override_column) to override a specific column config without influencing other columns' order/presence.
  * Grid's title is set to model's pluralized name by default.
  * New :read_only option for Form - makes all fields read-only and removes the "Apply" button.
  * Form implements DSL shortcuts for the following options in default config: :model, :items, :record_id.
  * GridPanel implements DSL shortcuts for the following options in default config: :model, :add_form_config, :edit_form_config, :multi_edit_form_config.
  * New Form option :multi_edit - set when the form is used for editing multiple records at a time
  * Introduce action columns (see BookGridWithColumnActions)

* API changes
  * Skip supporting ModelExtensions. The preferred way is using setters and getters on columns/fields.

# 0.7.1 - 2011-09-04
* bug fix
  * Form: fix the netzke_load endpoint when association fields are present
  * dates were not displayed in date fields, and submitting a form with date fields might result in erasing those fields

* Rails 3.1 compatibility
  * no meta_where dependencies (searching and filtering done with Arel)

# 0.7.0 - 2011-08-09
* Core 0.7.0 and Ext 4 compatibility
* API changes
  * [JS] Removed the helper BorderLayoutPanel#get<Region>Component method altogether. Use Ext 4 Container#child instead

# v0.6.5 - to be released
* enhancements
  * When columns states are saved in the persistent storage, adding/removing columns (e.g. in the code) will reset the saved states
  * Moved features and specs to test/basepack_test_app
* bug fix
  * Form with multiple association fields wouldn't submit data correctly
  * GridPanel's forms take over the `text` configuration option for columns as `fieldLabel` for default fields

# v0.6.4 - 2011-02-26
* API changes
  * The combo field able to talk to the server has changed its xtype from combobox to netzkeremotecombo. When getting values from the server via AJAX, it expects a 2-dimensional array now, where the first value is the real value (which gets submitted), and the second value is the display value.
  * xdatetime is no more. datetimefield is used instead.

* enhancements
  * Components updated to use Ext.Direct (by @pschyska)
  * New, improved advanced search for GridPanel and PagingForm.
  * One-to-many association support in Form/GridPanel reworked to use the foreign id instead of a string. This gives us more flexibility about what to display in the association column/field, and also provides for performance improvements (no more need to search for the associated record based on the value provided from the column/field).
  * GridPanel now memorizes its columns visibility, position and size (when :persistence is set to true)
  * I18n for GridPanel
  * A default value can now also be assigned to association column/field (the value must be the associated record's ID)
  * Slightly optimized selenium tests (no artificial sleeping whenever possible)

* bug fix
  * Long-standing visual issues with datetime columns in grid panel are solved.

# v0.6.3 - 2011-01-14

  * Filtering/sorting on virtual columns is now disabled by default
  * Filtering on date columns

* enhancements
  * I18n for Grid/Form
  * new `getter` config option for columns/fields, a lambda receiving the record as parameter
  * new `setter` config option for columns/fields, a lambda receiving the record as first parameter, new value as the second
  * GridPanel passes columns' default values to the "Add in form" form
  * Form can now be used without specifying a model
  * New `commalistcbg` form field for checkboxes, where boxLabels of selected checkboxes are serialized into comma-separated string (the separator is configurable)
  * New `nradiogroup` form field for radio buttons, where the value is defined by the boxLabel of the selected radio button
  * New `no_binding` option for configuring a form field. Set it to "true" when you don't want Netzke to expand the field configuration based on the `name` property. May be needed in some cases, e.g. when using checkboxes/radio buttons in the form.
  * New `nested_attribute` option for configuring data attributes (thus applicable for a column, a field, or a `netzke_attribute` in the model). When set to true for an association attribute (e.g. author__name), assigning a value to it will change the association's attribute, *not* trying to find an association by name and reassign it if found (default behavior).
  * Form shows the "Updating..." mask while sending values to the server (configurable with updateMask option/property)
  * Form now can be used in the "lockable" mode (:config => :lockable), which makes it load initially in "display mode", then "unlock" it, change the values, and "lock" it again (updating the values on the server)

# v0.6.2 - 2010-11-05

* enhancements

  * GridPanel: you can now configure add/edit/multi_edit/search panels (e.g. to override the fields) and corresponding windows (e.g. to override the title)
