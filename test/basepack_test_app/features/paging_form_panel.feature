@javascript
Scenario: Paging through records
  When I go to the BookPagingFormPanel test page
  Then I should see "Journey to Ixtlan"

  When I go forward one page
  And  I wait for the response from the server
  Then the form should show title: "Lolita"

  When I go forward one page
  And  I wait for the response from the server
  Then the form should show title: "Getting Things Done"

#@javascript
#Scenario: Searching
  #When I go to the BookPagingFormPanel test page
  #And I press "Search"
  #And I wait for the response from the server
  #And I expand combobox "undefined_attr"
  #And I select "Exemplars" from combobox "undefined_attr"
  #And I expand combobox "exemplars_operator"
  #And I select "Less than" from combobox "exemplars_operator"
  #And I fill in "exemplars_value" with "5"
  #And I press "Search" within "#book_paging_form_panel__search_form"
  #And I wait for the response from the server
  #Then the form should show title: "Getting Things Done"

@javascript
Scenario: I must see total records value
