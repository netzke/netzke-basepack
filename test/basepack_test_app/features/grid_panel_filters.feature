@javascript
Scenario: Numeric and text filter
  When I go to the BookGridFiltering test page
  And I enable filter on column "exemplars" with value "{gt:6}"
  Then the grid should show 1 records

  When I clear all filters in the grid
  And I enable filter on column "exemplars" with value "{eq:5}"
  Then the grid should show 1 records

  When I clear all filters in the grid
  And I enable filter on column "exemplars" with value "{eq:6}"
  Then the grid should show 0 records

  # NOTE: due to some mystery, this wouldn't work in a separate scenario (e.g. "Text filter")
  # That is, the filter just wouldn't get set.
  When I clear all filters in the grid
  And I enable filter on column "notes" with value "'read'"
  Then the grid should show 2 records

  When I clear all filters in the grid
  And I enable filter on column "author__first_name" with value "'d'"
  Then the grid should show 2 records

  And I enable filter on column "author__first_name" with value "'carl'"

  And I enable date filter on column "last_read_at" with value "after 04/25/2011"
  Then the grid should show 1 records
